# PART II: Creating ML-based Self-learning IoT Devices

In this session, we brefily present and demo three frameworks

1. Edge2Train to enable onboard resource-friendly training of SVM models
2. Train++ for ultra-fast incremental onboard classifier training and inference
3. ML-MCU to train up to a 50 class ML classifiers on a $ 3 device ESP32 MCU board.

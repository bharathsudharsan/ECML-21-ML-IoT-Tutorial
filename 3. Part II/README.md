# PART II: Creating ML-based Self-learning IoT Devices

In this tutorial session, we briefly present and demonstrate the following three frameworks:

1. Edge2Train to enable onboard resource-friendly training of SVM models
2. Train++ for ultra-fast incremental onboard classifier training and inference
3. ML-MCU to train up to 50 class ML classifiers on a $ 3 device ESP32 MCU board

Then leveraging the basics from Part I and thus demonstrated frameworks, we will teach the audience how to create self-learning IoT devices/products.

**Take Home Information:** The audience would have learned how to make their IoT devices/products self-learn/train on-the-fly, using live IoT use-case data. Thus, their devices can self-learn to perform analytics for any target IoT use cases.

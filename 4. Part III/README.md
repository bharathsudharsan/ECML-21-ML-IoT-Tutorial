# PART III: Deep Optimizations of CNNs and Efficient Deployment on IoT Devices

We will start this tutorial session with a smart video doorbell motivation scenario [1]. We then show the audience how to utilize the multi-component ML model optimization code to generate resource-friendly video analytics models (face, violence, and theft detection) that can be deployed and executed on the hardware of video doorbells. This method enables even the resource-constrained doorbells to perform ultra-fast offline analytics without depending on internet and cloud subscriptions.

# PART III: Deep Optimizations of CNNs and Efficient Deployment on IoT Devices

We will start this tutorial session with a smart video doorbell motivation scenario [1]. Then demonstrate to the audience how to utilize the multi-component ML model optimization code to generate resource-friendly video analytics models (face, violence, and theft detection) that can be deployed and executed on the hardware of video doorbells. This method enables even the resource-constrained doorbells to perform ultra-fast offline analytics without depending on internet and cloud subscriptions.

**Duration:** 50 mins in total with 20 minutes of slides presentation, 20 minutes of live demo, and 10 minutes for Q&A.

**Speakers:** [Bharath Sudharsan](https://bharathsudharsan.github.io/profile/) and [Pankesh Patel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F6gJdIAAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Take Home Information:** The audience can apply the learned techniques on the models from a growing number of use-cases such as anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice recognition, machine vision, etc., to enable standalone device-level execution. Thus, we believe this part of the tutorial opens future avenues for a broad-spectrum of applied research works.
